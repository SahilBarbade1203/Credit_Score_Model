Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop an automated credit score classification system using deep learning and machine learning techniques to predict creditworthiness accurately.

Methodology:

The proposed system will use both deep learning and machine learning algorithms to classify three credit scores i.e Standard, Good and Poor.

The system will be trained on a dataset of historical credit scores, which will include features such as credit history, income, employment status, and debt-to-income ratio.

The system will employ several techniques to improve the accuracy of credit score classification, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning.

Deep learning algorithms, such as neural networks, will be used to capture complex relationships between variables, while machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and logistic regression, will be used to identify important features.

The system will be tested using a separate test dataset to evaluate its accuracy and generalization performance. The system's performance will be compared to traditional credit scoring models to assess its effectiveness.
